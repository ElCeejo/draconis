While most who manage to 
obtain a Dragon Egg choose to 
keep them on a pedastal as a 
display of wealth, that doesn't 
stop many from trying to hatch 
them. The process is said to 
involve recreating the 
environment of a nest at a 
smaller scale using piles of 
bone, after this the Egg visibly 
"awakens" and is ready to 
hatch.
