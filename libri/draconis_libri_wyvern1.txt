Chapter 2: Wyverns

Jungle Wyverns are small 
relatives of Dragons. Though 
they lack the size and power of 
a Dragon, they are more 
aggressive and will actively 
seek out interlopers. Taming 
them is similar to taming a 
Horse, the main difference is 
Horses cannot fly to dizzying 
heights and tremendous 
speeds.
