Fighting Dragons is not a 
simple feat. Their ranged 
attacks and heavy close 
quarters attacks making 
landing a shot at any distance 
incredibly difficult. The 
optimal strategy is to use 
heavy cover and wait for an 
opportunity to land a hit. Upon 
defeat, Dragon corpses can be 
looted for Bones, Scales, and 
Eggs (Though the latter is 
incredibly rare).
