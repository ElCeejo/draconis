Chapter 1: Dragons

Large and immensely powerful 
winged reptiles with a 
domineering presence. Across 
the world, in blistering deserts 
and freezing tundras, Dragons 
reign at the top of the food 
chain. Their large wings propel 
them to great speeds, and their 
powerful jets of fire or ice 
quickly take down enemies and 
prey.
