Building a Forge requires a 
material hardened against the 
strength of a Dragon's 
powerful breath attacks. The 
go-to blueprint requires 
Dragonstone Blocks for the 
frame and core, as well as 
Dragonstone Bricks for the 
outer shell. Dragonstone 
Blocks are created by dropping 
a stack of stone on the ground 
and using your Dragon's breath 
on it.
